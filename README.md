# ShareGram-using-Django

Social Media are websites and applications that enable users to create and share content or to participate in social networking.

Created a social media app(ShareGram) using the Django framework. It has security features like registrations that prevent anyone from accessing or viewing the app without registration. The app allows you to post blogs and pictures without revealing user information.  This is a great platform for people willing to post interesting blogs and share creative ideas anonymously.
